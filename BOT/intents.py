Intents Configuration
------------------------------------

Copyright Â© 2023

Description:
    This module defines and configures the Discord Intents.
    Discord Intents allow the bot to receive specific events based on user activities.
    This module provides a centralized location to manage and customize the bot's intents
    for various events, ensuring granular control over the bot's interaction with Discord servers.

Author:
    Ethan Smith

Usage:
    Modify the 'get_intents' function to enable or disable specific intents based on the bot's requirements.
    Discord provides both general and privileged intents, where privileged intents require additional
    permissions and approval on the Discord Developer Portal.

Available Intents:
    - bans
    - dm_messages
    - dm_reactions
    - dm_typing
    - emojis
    - emojis_and_stickers
    - guild_messages
    - guild_reactions
    - guild_scheduled_events
    - guild_typing
    - guilds
    - integrations
    - invites
    - messages
    - reactions
    - typing
    - voice_states
    - webhooks

Privileged Intents (Requires approval on Discord Developer Portal):
    - members
    - message_content
    - presences

Notes:
    Ensure that the intents configured here align with the bot's functionality and comply with Discord's
    intent policy. Refer to the Discord API documentation for more information on Discord Intents.
